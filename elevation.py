"""#280 — North Elevation drop plan: endpoints, audiences, and the external payload.

SECURITY MODEL — this ships to outside parties, so read this before editing anything.

TWO AUDIENCES, NOT THREE. Per the operator's correction to the earlier mockup:
  * INTERNAL  admin / c_suite / pm / super / estimator
      Everything, plus paint mode (the only roles that may change a status).
  * EXTERNAL  architect / client — ONE view, IDENTICAL for both.
      Same drawing, same DROP n labels, same grids, same dimension strings, same
      statuses INCLUDING rework (a field condition, not an internal metric), and the
      same `reason` text. They differ only in WRITE rights, never in what they see:
      architect may comment / raise RFIs / request meetings; client is read-only.

WHAT NEVER LEAVES THE BUILDING (asserted in tests/smoke_elevation_280.py):
  * elevation_cell.internal_note — never selected into an external payload, at all.
  * SLA / performance metrics, estimate stages, cost, rates, margin — none of these
    exist in this module's queries, by construction.

THE TWO-FIELD REASON SPLIT IS THIS BUILD'S SECURITY MECHANISM. The phase-2 client
registry + client_payload() serialiser do not exist yet, so "external" and "internal"
are separate COLUMNS rather than a filtering rule applied to one column:
    reason         EXTERNAL by construction — shown to architect and client
    internal_note  INTERNAL by construction — excluded by not being selected
The operating rule for whoever is typing: the reason is what you would say to the
architect's face. Anything else goes in the internal note.

DEBT, RECORDED DELIBERATELY (#280 -> phase 2): every external endpoint here builds its
payload from a HAND-CURATED NARROW SELECT naming each column. No SELECT *, no model
dump. When phase 2 lands the client-field registry and client_payload(), these
endpoints get routed through it and the hand-curation is deleted. Until then the narrow
SELECT is the guarantee, and the smoke asserts it holds.

PROJECT SCOPING: an architect is scoped to ASSIGNED PROJECTS ONLY, reusing the existing
#263 pm_project_assignment grant — never a parallel mechanism, and never "all projects".
