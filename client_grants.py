"""#269 — SELECTIVE CLIENT UN-GATING: per-client, per-section, DEFAULT-OFF access grants.

The "gated day 1, unlock over time" mechanism (North Star §6/§8). This module owns the
SECTION-grant layer — the first of the TWO independent default-deny dials a client sits
behind (both server-enforced; hiding UI is never the control):

  1. SECTION grant (here, client_section_grant) — may the client see the section AT ALL.
     Presence of a row = unlocked; NO row = locked. A client with ZERO granted sections
     stays hard-contained on /welcome exactly as #267 built it.
  2. ITEM visibility (#264, visibility.py)      — within photos/documents, WHICH items.
     Still default-deny, shared one item at a time; red-flag still takes items offline.

So "photos granted" shows the photos SECTION rendering ONLY the individually
client-shared photos; an unshared photo stays invisible (and 404 by ID) even inside a
granted section.

Enforcement points:
  * client_portal._client_gate consumes granted_sections() to route: 0 grants -> the
    #267 welcome hard-stop (unchanged); >=1 grant -> the portal, which renders ONLY
    granted sections.
  * every /api/portal/<section> endpoint calls require_section() — grant + project
    scope re-derived per request; a non-granted section's endpoint returns 403 to the
    client no matter how it's addressed.
  * the grant/revoke/list endpoints below are admin/c_suite ONLY (@requires_company).

PII discipline (CLAUDE.md): payloads carry user_id / email / display_name / project_code
/ section names only — never worker names, rates, PINs, or *_path values. Dates are
LOCAL ISO (never UTC). All SQL is parameterized and routes through the caller's db_layer
connection — identical on SQLite (default/production) and Postgres.

# per-section toggles remain the fine-grained control). Order = SECTIONS order.
# #281 — "full" is now an EXPLICIT tuple, not a reference to SECTIONS.
#
# It used to be `"full": SECTIONS`, so adding a grantable key silently added it to the
# Full preset — every client on Full would have been granted the four new sections the
# moment the catalog grew, with nobody deciding that. A preset is an editorial choice
# about what a bundle means; the catalog is just what exists. They must not be the same
# object.
#
# The four new keys (drawing, weekly, materials, rfis) are DELIBERATELY IN NO PRESET
# pending the operator's bundling decision. They remain individually grantable and
# default OFF, so nothing is blocked — only the one-click bundles wait.
