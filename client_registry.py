"""#281 — the client field registry + client_payload(). The one place that decides what
an external audience is allowed to receive.

WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is built before any portal route:
twelve sections exposed to outside parties, hand-curated one narrow SELECT at a time, is
the failure mode this whole design has been working against. The blast radius of getting
one of them wrong is an outside party reading an internal note. So the filtering does not
live in the routes — it lives here, once, and every mirrored route goes through it.

===========================================================================
PROVENANCE, NOT VOCABULARY  (the operator's amendment 2)
===========================================================================
The FIRST LINE is not "scan the output for bad words". It is: every value in a client
payload must trace to a field explicitly marked client-safe.

  * DEFAULT-DENY ALLOWLIST IS THE GATE. A field absent from DATASETS below is not
    emitted. A column added to a table next month is invisible here until somebody
    registers it — the new column is internal by default, which is the only posture that
    survives a schema that keeps growing.

  * THE INTERNAL-NAME PATTERNS ARE A SECOND ASSERTION OVER THE REGISTRY ITSELF, not a
    substitute for it. `*_reason`, `*_note`, `internal_*`, `*_uid`, owner/worker ids —
    if one of those is ever REGISTERED as client-safe, assert_registry_clean() fails
    loudly at import and in the gate. They guard the allowlist; they do not replace it.
    A name-pattern denylist alone would miss `hold_category`, `margin_pct`,
    `sla_breach_days`, `voided_by_uid` — none of which match a pattern, all of which are
    internal.

  * A FREE-TEXT FIELD CAN NEVER BE SAFELY STRING-MATCHED. "On hold · client budget" and
    "waiting on their funding call" are the same disclosure; no denylist catches both.
    Exclusion at the source is the only thing that works, which is what the allowlist is.

  * THE INTERNAL STATUS KEY NEVER SHIPS. status_tone.client_key is what goes out. Even
    where the two spell the same word today, the payload is built from client_key so a
    module whose internal keys are not client-safe inherits a working mechanism instead
    of needing one invented.

The forbidden-string scan still exists — in the leak test, as the SECOND line. It catches
the one thing provenance cannot see: an internal value hand-copied into a registered-safe
field by a person.
