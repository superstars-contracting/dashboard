"""Weekly hours-worked computation, source-of-truth = sign_in_log.

Single helper for hours WORKED (labor actually performed) used by both
the DCR labor section and the weekly Hours Log so the two views can
never drift apart. Lunch is ALWAYS subtracted — every day gets a
30-minute deduction regardless of shift length (per
HANDOFF_WEEKLY_HOURS_LOG).

Naming note (intentional): we say "worked," not "paid." Whether
those hours ultimately get paid is a downstream manual decision
(an early-leave for "personal" may be unpaid; "sent home — weather"
may be paid). The number is the same; the framing avoids implying
the system makes pay-or-not calls.

Forward note (task #64, NOT this commit): time_in / time_out are the
BILLABLE in/out times. When the live PIN model lands, attendance
timestamps will be added on a separate column so payroll keeps
reading from these billable fields without redefinition.

    Worker pool (#244): employees with at least one ACTIVE project_assignment,
    further scoped by labor_worker_state.status — the single source of truth
    for the active roster since #241 (LEFT-JOIN semantics: no state row =
    active). A worker on the sheet is either
      - labor-ACTIVE (including zero-hour workers — those are the "no
        sign-ins" payroll exception, counted in no_signin_count), or
      - labor-INACTIVE but with hours in THIS week (check-cutting history
        must not rewrite when a worker is later retired).
    Inactive workers with zero hours in the week are not part of the
    week's roster at all — retired, not "no sign-ins."

    KNOWN LIMITATION (reported in #244, deliberately not silently chosen):
    the model stores only CURRENT status. Approved 'deactivate' rows are
    timestamped in labor_rate_change, but reactivation is an instant
    status flip with no history row — so "was this worker active during
    week X" is NOT answerable for arbitrary past weeks. Consequence: a
    worker who was active-with-zero-hours in a past week and was deactivated
    afterwards will not appear on that past week's sheet. Workers with
    hours always appear, so payable history is never rewritten.

    Sums hours across all projects for a given (worker, date) — payroll
    doesn't care which project a worker was on, just the total.
