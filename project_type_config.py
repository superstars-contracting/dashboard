"""project_type_config.py — Reports Phase 1 single source for the shared
spine (Handoff HANDOFF_REPORTS_PHASE1_SPINE.md).

Mirrors construction_builds_spec.json verbatim — `project_types.types[]`
plus the shared-field definitions and the location_reference shape.
Every future build (Weekly Summary, Two-Week Look-Ahead, RFI Log,
Phases 2-4) reads from HERE; do NOT duplicate any list into templates,
seeds, or per-build modules.

Exposed via:
  - PROJECT_TYPES                   (the 5 type dicts)
  - PROJECT_TYPE_IDS                (frozenset of valid ids)
  - STATUS_ENUM                     (the shared status superset)
  - LOCATION_REFERENCE_SCHEMA       (the persisted column shape)
  - SHARED_FIELD_DEFS               (scope_category, status, *_impact_flag)
  - get_project_type(type_id)       (one type dict by id)
  - get_project_config_for(conn, project_code)
                                    (resolves a project_code -> full config)

Updates: when the spec changes, edit this file and bump SPINE_VERSION.
The spec JSON in C:\\Users\\SSC-Admin\\Documents\\Claude\\Projects\\Superstars
Dashboard\\construction_builds_spec.json is the ultimate source of truth;
this module is its in-tree implementation mirror.
