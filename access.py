"""#262 — central role-based section access (RBAC). ONE source of truth.

Both the dashboard sidebar (rendered server-side — gated SECTION blocks are stripped
from the served HTML per role) AND the gated API endpoints read `SECTION_ACCESS`, so
access for a section changes in exactly one place. Role-based only — no per-user perms.

Sections NOT listed here default to ALL dashboard roles, so `pm` keeps every
operational section (Compliance, Drop Plan, Field Photos, Look-ahead, ...). Only the
gated sections restrict: **Financial** (Schedule of Values + Labor Rate Tracker, which
carry contract/billing financials) → admin/c_suite only. `super` gets the default
(everything except the gated Financial section).
