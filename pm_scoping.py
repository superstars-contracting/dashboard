"""#263 — PM project-scoping: project-membership assignment + access enforcement.

Two INDEPENDENT axes (see access.py / CLAUDE.md):
  * ROLE       -> which SECTIONS a user can reach (access.SECTION_ACCESS, #262) and
                 company-vs-project (access.can_access_company, #263).
  * ASSIGNMENT -> which PROJECTS a `pm` may open (the pm_project_assignment table).

This module owns the ASSIGNMENT axis end to end:
  * pm_can_access_project(role, user_id, code) — the ONE predicate, server-enforced.
  * a before_request hook that rejects any request whose path carries a project_code
    (`/projects/<code>` or `…/projects/<code>/…`, incl. /api/dropplan/projects/<code>/)
    the current user can't access — one choke point covers every project-scoped route.
  * admin/c_suite-only endpoints to assign/unassign a pm's projects + close/reopen a
    project (the lifecycle). A pm (or anyone non-company) CANNOT assign — 403.
  * project-list scoping: a pm sees only assigned ACTIVE projects (closed excluded).

SECURITY: enforced SERVER-SIDE. Hiding nav is not access control — a crafted request
from a pm for an unassigned (or closed) project, or for the company console, is rejected
here with 403, never served the data.

PII discipline (CLAUDE.md): assignment payloads carry user_id / project_code / role /
display_name / email only — never worker names, rates, PINs, or *_path values. Dates are
LOCAL ISO strings (never UTC). All SQL is parameterized and routed through db_layer so it
runs identically on SQLite (default/production) and Postgres (the dual-backend gate).
