"""Sign-in ↔ DCR-artifact divergence detection + reconciliation (#191).

ARCHITECTURAL NOTE — this module exists as DEFENSIVE invariant infrastructure,
not as the fix to a current divergence. A full diagnostic over
FR-BX-001's 16 issued DCRs across 5-04..5-25 (104 (date, W-####) pairs)
returned ZERO divergences. The handoff's premise — "sign_in_log and the
DCR roster silently diverge" — is falsified by the data at the time
#191 ships.

What the architecture actually says about direction-of-truth:

  sign_in_log IS the source of truth for who-was-on-site-when. The
  issued DCR is a FROZEN RENDERING derived from sign_in_log at issue
  time, persisted as `data_room/reports/dcr/<project>/<seq>/internal.html`
  (and `client.html`). After issuance, every sign_in_log mutation path
  (POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE on /api/sign-ins/...) calls
  `_mark_dcr_stale(conn, project_code, report_date)` which sets
  `report_index.stale = 1` for any issued DCR on that date. The
  staling flow runs **DCR → log direction only**: a sign_in_log edit
  ages out the DCR; a DCR delete does NOT touch sign_in_log (the
  /api/projects/<p>/reports/by-sequence/<seq> DELETE only removes
  report_index + HTML artifacts).

That asymmetry is the architectural reason the diagnostic found zero
divergences: edits flow inward to the log, and the DCR catches up via
re-issue. There is no code path that mutates the DCR roster in a way
that bypasses sign_in_log — because the DCR roster IS rendered from
sign_in_log; it has no independent storage.

Given the above, the right framing for this invariant is:

  Detect: any (date, W-####) where the rendered DCR artifact's W-####
  roster disagrees with what sign_in_log currently has for the same
  (project_code, date). This would surface, for example:
    - A sign_in_log row deleted directly via DB (bypassing the API
      gates) — never expected in normal operation but possible during
      manual recovery.
    - A future code path that adds a worker to the DCR roster without
      writing sign_in_log (no such path exists today; the invariant
      would surface it the moment one is introduced).
    - Smoke-test corruption (post-#175 audit closed this; the invariant
      catches a future regression).

  Reconcile: for `in_dcr_not_log` divergences (DCR artifact says worker
  was there; log doesn't), INSERT the missing sign_in_log row using the
  DCR artifact as source-of-truth. Default time_in='07:00', time_out=
  '15:30' (8-hr day, matches existing operator-entered rows). Audit log
  per restore with PII-safe `{log_present: bool, source: 'dcr',
  report_id}` payloads — never raw values.

  Do NOT auto-delete: for `in_log_not_dcr` divergences (log has worker;
  DCR roster doesn't), surface in the report and let the operator
  decide. These could be legitimate (manual sign-ins recorded after DCR
  issuance) or could be orphans from a failed flow.

PII discipline (per CLAUDE.md PII rule): this module returns and
audit-logs `worker_id` (W-####), `date`, `report_id`, and presence
booleans only. Worker names, phone numbers, employee_ids in error
messages are forbidden. Hours and rates never appear in audit payloads.

# Kevin W-0003 on 2026-05-21 — DCR-014 was issued without him). By the

# roster, refuse to issue silently — return a structured response the
# UI uses to surface a modal. The operator either acknowledges the
# absence (worker really is off today) or adds the worker with a
# default shift. Either way, the omission can't ship silently.
