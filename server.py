# (material-alerts #272b, project-costs #278) from saved layouts: drags "saved"
# but the new widgets' positions were discarded server-side (operator-reported
# live). Enumerated lists rot — the #275 lesson, server-side edition. The
# security property (layout_json can never carry injected data) is preserved
# STRUCTURALLY instead: ids must match a strict charset/length pattern; whether
# an id corresponds to a real widget is the client's concern (dash_layout drops
# ids with no matching grid item on load).

# ============= PAYROLL: WEEKLY HOURS LOG =============

@app.route('/api/payroll/hours', methods=['GET'])
def api_payroll_hours():
    """Weekly Hours grid for payroll. Source of truth = sign_in_log.

    Query params:
      week_start (optional, ISO 'YYYY-MM-DD'): the Monday of the week. If
        omitted, defaults to the last completed Mon-Fri week relative to
        today (payroll runs one week in arrears).

    Returns the payroll_hours.build_week_grid dict: dates, workers (with
    per-day cells + weekly totals), totals_by_day, grand_total. Worker pool
    = employees with at least one active project_assignment.

    Role-gated comp data (#158): if the requester's role is
    'admin' / 'c_suite', each worker carries `hourly_rate` and
    `amount_owed` for THIS week. For all other roles those keys are
    OMITTED ENTIRELY (not zeroed, not "—") so a sniffed payload
    reveals nothing about pay (per CLAUDE.md comp-data rule + #146
    handoff).

    #197 — Rate lookup is PER-DAY-WORKED, not as-of-week-start. Each
    sign_in_log row gets joined to the rate effective on its own date.
    `amount_owed` = SUM(day_hours * rate_effective_on(day_date)) across
    the week. `rate_not_set` is True only when the worker has no
    active rate on ANY day they actually worked.

    Why: the prior as-of-week-start lookup mis-rendered "Rate not set"
    for any worker whose `effective_from` fell mid-week — including
    every new hire and every operator-side rate change that wasn't
    aligned to a Monday. Mario W-0007's effective_from=2026-05-13
    against week_start=2026-05-11 was the operator-reported instance.
    The structural fix is per-day, not per-week.
