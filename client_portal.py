"""#264 CLIENT portal + the client DEFAULT-DENY gate — #267 welcome hard-stop,
#269 selective per-section un-gating.

The most security-sensitive surface in the app. Posture (TWO default-deny layers, both
server-enforced — hiding UI is never the control):

  * SECTION GRANTS (#269, client_grants.py). Every portal section (progress / photos /
    documents / daily / schedule) starts OFF. A client with ZERO granted sections is
    HARD-CONTAINED on /welcome exactly as #267 built it: every other page redirects to
    /welcome, every API returns 403. Granting sections (admin/c_suite only) unlocks the
    portal ONE SECTION AT A TIME: the portal page renders ONLY granted sections, and every
    /api/portal/<section> endpoint re-checks its grant per request — a non-granted
    section's endpoint is 403 no matter how it's addressed.
  * PER-ITEM VISIBILITY (#264, visibility.py). Within photos AND documents (#269 extends
    the engine to documents), only individually client-shared, non-red-flagged items are
    served. A granted section shows ONLY its shared items.
  * PROJECT-SCOPED. A client is assigned to exactly ONE project (pm_project_assignment,
    generalized from #263). They see only that project, and only while it is active.
  * PER-RESOURCE ISOLATION (closes the #263 by-ID gap). Every by-ID fetch re-derives
    ownership from the row: a photo/document serves ONLY if it BELONGS to the client's
    project AND is shared to the `client` audience AND is not red-flagged (visibility.py).
    Guessing an id from another project or an unshared item yields 404 — never the bytes.
  * CURATED-ONLY PAYLOAD. The portal serializes id / caption / title / date / gated URLs
    only — never cost, labor, worker PII, file paths, uploader, or any internal field
    (CLAUDE.md).
  * READ-ONLY. The portal exposes no write endpoint.

Production stays on SQLite; all SQL routes through the caller's db_layer connection so it
runs identically on Postgres. Dates are LOCAL.
