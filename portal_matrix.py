"""#284 — the ROLE x SECTION matrix + the effective-sections resolver.

The THIRD dial in the external-access model, sitting above the two that exist:

  1. ROLE -> sections   (this module)  what a role COULD EVER be shown. A section
                                       absent from a role's row here is never
                                       rendered and its API is 403 for that role,
                                       grant or no grant.
  2. GRANT -> sections  (#269)         what THIS user has been opened, default OFF.
  3. ITEM visibility    (#264)         which items inside a granted section.

EFFECTIVE = MATRIX[role] ∩ GRANTS(user). Both operands are default-deny, so the
intersection is too:

  * a role not seeded here (vendor, or any role added later) has an EMPTY row —
    the shell renders nothing and every portal payload endpoint refuses. A new
    external role is dark until somebody writes its row on purpose.
  * a grant row for a section outside the role's matrix row changes nothing —
    the matrix bounds what a grant is ABLE to open (belt over the #269 braces).
  * an architect has no grant machinery at all today (client_section_grant is
    client-validated on write), so their effective set resolves EMPTY and the
    portal shell is not their surface — they keep landing on /drawing-markup.
    Their matrix row exists so the day architect grants are built, the bound is
    already decided rather than improvised.

ORDER: effective_sections returns client_grants.SECTIONS order (the portal
display order) so every consumer renders sections in the same sequence.
