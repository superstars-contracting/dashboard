Certificate of Fitness — issuance backend.

Business rules (locked with the user 2026-05-06):
  1) Hard prerequisite: employee MUST have a valid 16-hr Suspended Scaffold
     User certification (any cert_type with is_cof_prerequisite=1).
     If not, no CoF can be issued. Period.
  2) Expiration date = the EARLIEST expiration_date across ALL of the
     employee's tracked certifications (cert_types treated as a flat list).
     If OSHA-30 expires Aug 15 and 16-hr expires Dec 1, CoF expires Aug 15.
  3) Issued date = the date the issuer (CEO) hits "Sign & Issue" — captured
     server-side, not client-side.
  4) Signature = the file path stored in app_settings.issuer_signature_path,
     applied to all cards in the batch.
  5) Card numbers = SSC-COF-{employee_id} (e.g., SSC-COF-E-00013).
     Card number is unique per worker — re-issuing reuses the same number
     and supersedes the prior card.

Usage:
  python cof_issuer.py status                    # eligibility report for all employees
  python cof_issuer.py issue <emp_id> [<emp_id>]  # batch issue cards
  python cof_issuer.py preview <emp_id>           # dry run — show what would be issued
